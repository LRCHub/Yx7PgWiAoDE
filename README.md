[00:13.80] We're the Daywalkers
[00:15.45] We got the power of the sun
[00:17.45] Here, it's way hotter
[00:18.71] Won't take no shade from anyone
[00:20.84] Check the showstopper
[00:22.17] We make a fire all our own
[00:25.65] Thanks to the Lightstone
[00:37.65] 
[00:27.35] Number one status
[00:29.10] Those sneaky vamps are gonna learn
[00:30.96] Try to come at us
[00:32.41] You're gonna go home with a burn
[00:34.20] We're the real baddest
[00:35.77] With all our solar-powered flare
[00:39.08] It's almost unfair
[00:48.08] 
[00:40.97] Lucky you
[00:43.52] For stumbling through
[00:54.02] 
[00:46.93] Welcome to the light side, light side
[00:49.67] It's better on the bright side, bright side
[00:53.06] You know we're the most unforgettable
[00:55.84] You'll ever see (whoa)
[00:57.87] Want incredible?
[00:59.62] This is the place to be!
[01:11.62] 
[01:01.66] Na-na-na-na-na
[01:03.59] Na-na-na-na-na
[01:05.27] Na-na-na-na-na
[01:06.36] This is the place to be!
[01:18.36] 
[01:08.34] We're the Vampires
[01:09.95] We come out underneath the moon
[01:11.60] Never get tired
[01:13.28] Of looking effortlessly cool
[01:14.94] Soaring way higher
[01:16.50] Tellin' the wind which way to go
[01:19.34] Thanks to the Darkstone
[01:30.84] 
[01:21.59] Fear the Daywalkers
[01:23.21] 'Cause that's what Vamps have always done
[01:25.07] Lying smooth-talkers
[01:26.85] They play with fire just for fun!
[01:28.47] Hey, if they offer
[01:30.03] Maybe someday we'll all be friends
[01:32.86] Okay, we won't then
[01:42.36] 
[01:34.64] Lucky you
[01:37.62] For stumbling through
[01:48.12] 
[01:40.64] Welcome to the night side, night side
[01:43.70] The "we'll-be-takin'-flight" side, flight side
[01:47.10] You know we're the most unforgettable
[01:49.71] You'll ever see (whoa!)
[01:52.02] Want incredible?
[01:53.44] This is the place to be!
[02:05.44] 
[01:55.49] Na-na-na-na-na
[01:57.18] Na-na-na-na-na
[01:58.88] Na-na-na-na-na

[02:03.94] Na-na-na-na-na
[02:05.54] Na-na-na-na-na
[02:07.16] This is the place to be!
[02:19.16] 
[02:12.89] At last, I'll see the outside
[02:15.69] A shame it's only tonight
[02:19.10] Would any change be so bad?
[02:22.49] Does anybody understand?
[02:34.49] 
[02:25.86] There's life beyond the old fears
[02:29.24] A song my people don't hear
[02:32.80] I see a future they can't
[02:35.79] Does anybody understand?
[02:39.94] Does anybody understand?
[02:42.71] Does anybody understand?
[02:54.71] 
[02:51.66] Welcome to the light side (welcome to the night side)
[02:53.60] Light side (night side)
[02:54.87] It's better on the bright side (the "we'll-be-takin'-flight" side)
[02:56.69] Bright side (flight side)
[02:58.44] You know, we're the most unforgettable
[03:00.91] You'll ever see (whoa!)
[03:02.72] Want incredible?
[03:04.60] This is the place to be!
[03:16.60] 
[03:06.61] Na-na-na-na-na
[03:08.32] Na-na-na-na-na
[03:10.10] Na-na-na-na-na
[03:11.13] This is the place to be!
